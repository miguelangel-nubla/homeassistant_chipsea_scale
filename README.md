- Scales advertising as "Chipsea-BLE"
- SmartChef kitchen scales
- ProfiCook PC-KW series
- Generic scales with manufacturer ID 4298
- Scales using service UUID `0000fff0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to "Integrations" 
3. Click the 3 dots menu and select "Custom repositories"
4. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/miguelangel-nubla/homeassistant_chipsea_scale`
5. Select category "Integration" and click "Add"
6. Find "Chipsea Scale" in the list and click "Download"
7. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page][releases]
2. Extract the files to your `custom_components` directory:
   ```
   custom_components/
   └── chipsea_scale/
       ├── __init__.py
       ├── config_flow.py
       ├── coordinator.py
       ├── models.py
       ├── sensor.py
       ├── const.py
       ├── diagnostics.py
       ├── manifest.json
       ├── strings.json
       └── hacs.json
   ```
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "Chipsea Scale"
4. Follow the setup wizard:
   - Your scale should be automatically discovered
   - If not found, you can manually enter the Bluetooth address
5. The integration will create a weight sensor for your scale

## Usage

- **Power on your scale** by stepping on it or placing an item
- The weight sensor will show the current measurement in grams
- Additional attributes show the scale's native unit and raw reading
- When the scale goes to sleep, the entity becomes "unavailable"
- Wake the scale by using it again - the entity will immediately become available

## Sensor Attributes

The weight sensor provides these attributes:

- `scale_unit`: The unit reported by the scale (g, kg, lb, oz)
- `raw_weight`: The weight in the scale's native unit
- `decimal_places`: Number of decimal places from the scale
- `is_stable`: Whether the reading is stable
- `last_measurement`: Timestamp of the last reading

## Troubleshooting

### Scale Not Discovered
- Ensure the scale is powered on and in pairing/advertising mode
- Check that Bluetooth is enabled on your Home Assistant system
- Try manually adding the scale using its MAC address

### Connection Issues
- Battery-powered scales disconnect frequently to save power - this is normal
- The integration will automatically reconnect when the scale advertises
- Check the diagnostic information for connection statistics

### Getting Diagnostic Information
Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Chipsea Scale** → **Download Diagnostics** to get detailed information for troubleshooting.
